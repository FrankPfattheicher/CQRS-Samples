# CQRS-Samples
The idea is to provide minimal samples using CQRS.

I found several other samples showing this but hiding the essential idea by adding other concepts
* IoC containers
* Logging
* Mappers
* Message busses
* Caches
* Validation libraries

This tecniques may be essential in a real world application but users new to CQRS will be mixed up with that.

So the idea is to intentionally leave them out!

**IoC container**    
Not used, all required references are given explicit as constructor parameters.

**Logging**    
As a console application all logging is done to the console.

**Mappers**    
Properties are copied manually here.

**Message busses, Caches, Validation libraries**    
Not required to undestand the underlaying concepts.


# First Sample
Every reader should be common with their banking account so this should be the topic, other samples may follow.
